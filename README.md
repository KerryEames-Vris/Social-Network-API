## Motivation
I wanted to work on skills for navigating a MongoDB database with back end code. Learning how to make users and thoughts and add friends. Testing routes and commands to try to better understand the process and code
## Description
Just a bit of backend database navigation. You can use the Insomnia API and use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functionality to create the basics of a social media service. Create users, create thoughts, add friends, or remove and edit them all.
# Code Styles
Javascript
# Frameworks and Tech
Nodemon, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express
# Installation
Clone down the repo to your computer, and run an npm install in the root folder. After that run a node server.js and open your choice of routing API.
## Usage
It could potentially be the basics of a social media project, but really it was just for practice
